# Community Fact Sheet: Linking Work Schedules, Family Stability, and School Success

## The Problem: Unstable Work Schedules Harm Families

**What is a “precarious schedule”?**
- Last-minute shift changes
- Unpredictable hours week-to-week
- On-call shifts without guarantee of work
- Insufficient notice (less than 2 weeks)

**How does this affect families?**
- **Income volatility:** Can’t budget for rent, groceries, childcare
- **Childcare chaos:** Arrangements fall through, leading to missed work or children left unsupervised
- **Parental stress:** Chronic anxiety about hours, pay, and job security
- **Missed family time:** Parents miss school events, medical appointments, and family meals

**The ripple effect on children:**
- Children absorb household stress, which can manifest as:
  - Anxiety, depression, irritability
  - Difficulty focusing in school
  - Behavioral outbursts that are often misunderstood as defiance

## The Disproportionate Impact on African American Girls

**The data:**
- African American girls are suspended at rates **up to 6 times higher** than their white peers in some districts.
- They are more likely to be disciplined for subjective offenses like “defiance,” “disrespect,” or “disruption.”
- Many of these behaviors are trauma responses to household instability, not intentional misconduct.

**Why this happens:**
- Systemic racial and economic inequities mean Black families are more likely to work in low‑wage, precarious jobs with unstable schedules.
- Schools often lack trauma‑informed training and default to punitive discipline, pushing girls out of the classroom and into the juvenile justice system—the **school‑to‑prison pipeline**.

## The Solution: Fair Workweek Laws as a Trauma‑Informed Policy

**What is a Fair Workweek law?**
- **Advance notice:** Employers must post schedules at least 2 weeks in advance.
- **Predictability pay:** Workers are compensated for last‑minute changes.
- **Right to request stable hours:** Employees can ask for a consistent schedule without fear of retaliation.
- **Access to hours:** Part‑time workers have a right to be offered additional hours before new hires are brought on.

**How this supports families:**
- Creates **economic stability**—families can plan budgets, secure childcare, and pay bills on time.
- Reduces **household chaos**—parents know when they work and can be present for their children.
- Lowers **parental stress**—predictability reduces anxiety and improves mental health.
- Provides **more family time**—consistent schedules allow for regular meals, homework help, and school involvement.

**How this helps children in school:**
- Stable home environments lead to better emotional regulation and behavior in the classroom.
- Children arrive at school better rested, fed, and ready to learn.
- Teachers see fewer trauma‑driven behavioral incidents, reducing the need for punitive discipline.
