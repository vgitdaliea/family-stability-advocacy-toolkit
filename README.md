# Family Stability Advocacy Toolkit

## Mission Statement

This toolkit illuminates the critical intersection between **unstable workplace scheduling**, **household trauma**, and the **school discipline disparities** disproportionately affecting African American girls. 

Precarious work schedules—such as unpredictable shifts, last-minute changes, and insufficient notice—create chronic stress and economic instability for families. This instability exacerbates household trauma, which in turn impacts children's emotional and behavioral well-being. In schools, these stressors manifest as behavioral challenges that are often met with punitive discipline rather than supportive interventions, fueling the school-to-prison pipeline.

African American girls, in particular, face disproportionate rates of suspension, expulsion, and referrals to law enforcement. This disparity is not merely a matter of individual behavior but a systemic outcome of intersecting inequities: economic precarity, racial bias, and trauma. By addressing the root cause of unstable work schedules through "fair workweek" policies, we can reduce household stress, foster family stability, and create conditions that allow children—especially African American girls—to thrive in school.

This toolkit provides advocates, community organizers, and legislators with the evidence, arguments, and practical resources needed to:

1. **Advocate for "Fair Workweek" legislation** that guarantees predictable schedules, adequate notice, and access to stable hours.
2. **Promote trauma-informed practices** in schools that shift from punitive discipline to supportive, healing-centered approaches.
3. **Build cross-sector coalitions** that connect labor rights, racial justice, and education equity.
4. **Mobilize communities** through fact sheets, policy briefs, and model legislation comparisons.

Together, we can advance holistic policy solutions that break the cycle of instability, trauma, and discipline disparities, ensuring that every child has the opportunity to succeed.
